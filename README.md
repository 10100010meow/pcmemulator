# pcmemulator

This is a Motorola 68332 PCM emulator, written to better understand the firmware in my 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier.

It is a *heavily* modified version of the Capcom CPS1 arcade emulator at: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/998595/CPS-NET-a-Csharp-based-CPS-MAME-emulator

This code is literally garbage -- merely a means to an end for a weird project. If it helps you -- I mean, I'd love to hear about it, but seriously, you might be as damaged as I am.
